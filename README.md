# Cidercade
In this project, I have optimized jQuery enhancements (text duplication, sticky headers, dynamic menus), improved UX with class manipulation and columnized layouts, customized WooCommerce templates, added custom image sizes, streamlined assets (e.g., emojis, CSS), and enhanced performance with dynamic scripts and styles.
